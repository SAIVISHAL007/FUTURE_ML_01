# FUTURE_ML_01
Sales Forecasting Project | FUTURE_ML_01 This project focuses on predicting future sales trends from historical data. It involves preprocessing, forecasting, trend analysis, and visualization. Completed as part of Task 1 for my Machine Learning Internship under the FUTURE program

**Sales Forecasting Project**  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting future sales trends based on historical sales data using the **Prophet** forecasting model. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a model, and generate future sales predictions while analyzing trends and seasonal patterns.  

## Features  
✔ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, formatting dates)  
✔ Sales forecasting using Prophet  
✔ Trend and seasonality analysis  
✔ Performance evaluation (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)  
✔ Visualization of forecasts  

## Dataset  
The dataset (`sales_data_sample.csv`) consists of historical sales data with timestamps. The key columns include:  
- `ORDERDATE`: The date of sales transactions  
- `SALES`: The total sales amount for that date  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Prophet** (for forecasting)  
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib** (visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (error metrics)
